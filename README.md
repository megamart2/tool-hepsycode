# HW/SW CO-DEsign of HEterogeneous Parallel dedicated SYstems (Hepsycode)

## Installation instructions

### OVERVIEW
HepsyCode is a prototypal tool to improve the design time of embedded applications. It is based on a System-Level methodology for HW/SW Co-Design of Heterogeneous Parallel Dedicated Systems. The whole framework drives the designer from an Electronic System-Level (ESL) behavioral model, with related NF requirements, including real-time and mixed-criticality ones, to the final HW/SW implementation, considering specific HW technologies, scheduling policies  and Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms. The system behavior modeling language introduced in HepsyCode, named HML (HEPSY Modeling Language), is based on the Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) MoC. It allows modeling the behavior of the system as a network of processes communicating through unidirectional synchronous channels. By means of HML it is possible to specify the System Behavior Model (SBM), an executable model of the system behavior, a set of Nonâ€“Functional constraints (NFC) and a set  of Reference Inputs (RI) to be used for simulation-based activities. Throught the execution of different steps, including a system-level design space exploration  approach that allows the related co-design methodology to suggest an HW/SW partitioning of the application specification and a mapping of the partitioned entities onto an automatically defined heterogeneous multi-processor architecture, it is possible to proceed with system implementation.

HepsyCode uses Eclipse MDE technologies, SystemC custom simulator implementation and an  evolutionary genetic algorithm for partitioning activities, all integrated into an automatic frameworkthat drive the designer from first input to final solution.

This repository contains the HepsyCode framework, which consists of a set of 

- Reference libraries
- Scripts and makefiles
- Eclipse plugins 
- XML data exchange files
- SystemC files (part of the Hepsim simulator)
- HW/SW Partitioning And Mapping (PAM) tool

Users can found more information in the docs/ folder.

 4. Import in eclipse Hepsycode projects
 5. Install systemc library (it is recommended version 2.3.0)
 6. Go to /home/.bashrc and insert the path of systemc (folder lib-linux and include) the names of variable must be SYSTEMCPATHLIB and SYSTEMCPATHINCLUDE for example:
    - export SYSTEMCPATHLIB=/usr/local/systemc-2.3.0a/lib-linux64
    - export SYSTEMCPATHINCLUDE=/usr/local/systemc-2.3.0a/include
    - Alternative: launch settings.sh script
 7. Try and enjoy Hepsycode Tool!!!
